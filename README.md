<h1 align="center">Personal Diary </h1>

This is an Open-Source personal diary webapp with double check security system in which you can write your all you secrets without getting it reaveled by anyone.

This personal diary will have two diary :

           - one would original diary
           - another will be a dummy diary
           
Both the diaries can be accessed with two different password(you can set both the password of your choice), which you need to give while logging into your dairy, so the first password would be your password to your original diary while the other password will be for a dummy diary with automated story(which would seems like a original diary note).

So, if you fear that anyone can access to your diary or if you are under some pressure to show your diary to your friend then you can always show them your dummy diary by logging it through your second password. Now you can write your secrets without any fear of getting revealed.
 
Come forward to the contribute to the webapp !!!
